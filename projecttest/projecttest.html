                          Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.

                          Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these patients be 
                          isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of 
                          infecting others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made 
                          on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials and 
                          involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory 
                          testing for that patient.

                        <p>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence 
                          to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands 
                          with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or 
                          sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
                        </p>
                        <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has 
                          the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the 
                          virus spreads.
                        </p>
                        <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of 
                          spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen 
                          temperatures.

                      <p>Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local 
                        public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in 
                        China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so 
                        check regularly for the latest news.
                      </p>
                      <p>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:</p>
                      <ul class="list-dot">
                        <li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. 
                          <br>
                          <strong>Why?</strong> Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be
                          on your hands.
                        </li>
                        <li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. 
                          <br>
                          <strong>Why?</strong> When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which 
                          may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person 
                          coughing has the disease.
                        </li>
                        <li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. 
                          <br>
                          <strong>Why?</strong> Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the 
                          virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
                        </li>
                        <li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose 
                          with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. 
                          <br>
                          <strong>Why?</strong> Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you 
                          from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
                        </li>
                        <li>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and 
                          difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health 
                          authority. 
                          <br>
                          <strong>Why?</strong> National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on 
                          the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the 
                          right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If 
                          possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, 
                          heart or lung disease. 
                          <br>
                          <strong>Why?</strong> You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

                            medication(s) and care. You should help the patient with basic needs in the home and provide support for getting

                            sicker, call his or her healthcare provider and tell them that the patient has laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This 
                            will help the healthcare provider’s office take steps to keep other people in the office or waiting room from getting 
                            infected. Ask the healthcare provider to call the local or state health department for additional guidance. If the 
                            patient has a medical emergency and you need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that the patient has, or is 
                            being evaluated for COVID-19.

                          <li>Household members should stay in another room or be separated from the patient as

                                <li>Wear disposable gloves while handling soiled items and keep soiled items away from your body. Clean your hands (with soap and

                                </li>
                                <li>Read and follow directions on labels of laundry or clothing items and detergent. In general, using a normal laundry detergent 
                                  according to washing machine instructions and dry thoroughly using the warmest temperatures recommended on the clothing label.
                                </li>

                              Soap and water should be used preferentially if hands are visibly dirty.

                        <p>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence 
                          to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands 
                          with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or 
                          sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
                        </p>
                        <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, 
                          nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
                        </p>
                        <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread 
                          from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.
